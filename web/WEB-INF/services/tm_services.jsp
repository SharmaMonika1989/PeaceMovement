The first ever scientific research on TM was conducted by Dr. Robert Keith Wallace of U.S.A. who declared that during TM-the mind remains fully alert but the body goes to deep rest-deeper than sleep. This state of body and mind was termed as "Restful Alertness". Since then more than 600 independent scientific researches have been conducted on TM at numerous institutions in 32 countries covering all the areas of human development. The results of all these scientific research have been collectively published in six volumes of books titled "Scientific Research on Transcendental Meditation Programme -Collected Papers". All these research have shown innumerable benefits of TM for the mankind. Few among them are:</p>

This means we are only 5-15% effective. During TM we come into direct contact with the rest 85-95% of the mental potential we have not been using. Daily practice of TM, which takes about 15-20 minutes morning and evening, cultivate the energy and culture it-until it is always available for our spontaneous use. The mind becomes expanded and our awareness increases. The net result of mental benefits are given below:-</p>

The scientists who discovered this effect named it in honour of His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who predicted 30 years ago that only a small fraction of the population participating in the Transcendental Meditation programme would be sufficient to improve the quality of life of the whole society. During the past 16 years, this transformation of society has been documented scientifically, first at the city level, then at the state and the national levels, and most recently at: the global level- the Global Maharishi Effect.</p>
                                                                           <p class="para">It has been found that the proportion of members of a society necessary to generate the Maharishi Effect is one percent practicing Transcendental Meditation or only the square root of one percent participating in the group practice of the TM-Sidhi programme. This proportion is so small that the beneficial effects on society of the Maharishi Effect cannot be accounted for by behavioral interactions of the participants with the members of society. </p>

Dr. John Hagelin (1987), a leading physicist in the area of unified quantum field theory, points out that the great range of distance of the Maharishi Effect could only be understood as produced at the level of the Unified Field of all the Laws of Nature recently' identified by modem physics. </p>

During the past twenty years, physicists have been able to sequentially u unify the four fundamental forces of nature. Probing in-to the functioning of natural law, physicists have discovered that forces and particles that appear very different at the scales of time and distance with which we are usually familiar are in reality unified at deeper levels of nature. This progress has culminated. In the recent formulation of "superstring theory" which offers a complete mathematical description of the unified field of natural law.</p>

The TM-Sidhi program cultures the ability to think and act from this level. By learning to function from this self-referral state of pure consciousness, which is the total potential of Natural Law, the mind gains increasing Support of Nature for the fulfillment of desires. With the TM-Sidhi program, thought and action spontaneously become more in accord with the evolutionary power of Natural Law. This results in greater skill in action -- the ability to fulfill one's desires naturally while effortlessly promoting the evolution of everyone and everything.</p>

                                                                    <p class="year" style="text-align: center">Benefits to the Individual:</p>

Scientific research studies indicate that the TM-Sidhi program cultures a profound integration of brain functioning (EEG coherence). The enlivenment of pure consciousness during the TM-Sidhi program promotes an optimal state of brain functioning and provides the basis for the unfoldment of the individual's full creative intelligence.</p>

                                                                    <p class="year" style="text-align: center">EEG Coherence during the TM-Sidhi Yogic Flying Technique</p>

During the first stage of Yogic Flying, the body lifts up and moves forward in short hops. Subjectively one experiences exhilaration, lightness, and bliss. EEG studies show that during this practice, at the moment the body lifts up, coherence is maximum in brain wave activity. This optimum coherence in brain functioning creates perfect mind/body coordination which is expressed by the Yogic Flying. When Yogic Flying is practiced in groups, this influence of coherence spreads throughout the environment, reducing negative tendencies and promoting positive, harmonious trends in the whole society.</p>

Like the Transcendental Meditation technique, its benefits are practical, holistic, and scientifically validated. Individuals who have learned the TM-Sidhi program often comment that it accelerates the benefits of the Transcendental Meditation program, improving health, increasing happiness, and enhancing one's ability to gain support from the environment in fulfilling desires.  </li>

To date, over 40 scientific research studies have shown that even a small number of individuals -- approximately the square root of one percent of the population -- practicing this program together in one place generates a powerful influence of coherence in the collective consciousness of the whole population. Studies have shown reduced crime, sickness, and accident rates, as well as decreased international conflict and social turbulence. </li>

Throughout the world, people practicing the TM-Sidhi program individually and in groups have produced the Global Maharishi Effect -- coherence in world consciousness -- which has now resulted in the dawn of world peace. As more and more people practice the TM-Sidhi program, thereby increasing the Extended Maharishi Effect, mankind is going to enjoy the supreme quality of life on earth -- Heaven on Earth.</li>

In addition, statistics from an independent data base showed that casualties and fatalities due to international terrorism decreased an average of 72 percent during the assemblies.</p>

The Transcendental Meditation program, its Advanced Technique program, and the TM-Sidhi program are precious aspects of Maharishi Vedic Science and Technology. They are the practical means to create Heaven on Earth because they develop bliss consciousness in the individual, so that no matter where one may be on earth, one is always in Heaven. Furthermore, when practiced in groups, these programs enliven the Unified Field of Natural Law in collective consciousness, bringing the power of Natural Law, resulting in ever-increasing progress, happiness, success, and prosperity in the daily life of everyone in society. Therefore, you are cordially invited to practice the TM-Sidhi program and create Heaven on Earth for yourself and for all mankind.</p>
